My undergraduate research is focused on the one-dimensional modeling of two-phase natural ciruculation loops, mainly for their nuclear safety passive cooling applications.

I have a published paper on the numerical study of their steady state behaviour using the homogeneous equilibrium model, but I'm planning on upgrading the solver to use the drift-flux model. I use the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) to develop my simulation codes.
